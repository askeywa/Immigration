RewriteRule ^immigration-portal/login$ /immigration-portal-login-production.html [L]

# PRODUCTION-GRADE: Also serve at the root immigration portal path
RewriteRule ^immigration-portal/?$ /immigration-portal-login-production.html [L]

# Legacy support: Keep old login page for backward compatibility (optional)
RewriteRule ^immigration-portal/login-old$ /immigration-portal-login.html [L]

# API proxying is NO LONGER NEEDED for production-grade solution
# The production login page makes direct API calls to ibuyscrap.ca
# This is more reliable and doesn't require server-side proxying

# Optional: Redirect root to immigration portal login (uncomment if desired)
# RewriteRule ^$ /immigration-portal/login [R=301,L]
