# ⚠️ URGENT: USER ACTION REQUIRED

## 🎯 **Issue Identified:**

The deployment to `ibuyscrap.ca` was successful ✅, but the test is failing because:

**The `immigration-portal-login-production.html` file on `honeynwild.com` is OUTDATED!**

---

## 📊 **Test Results:**

```
✅ Backend API: Working (ibuyscrap.ca)
✅ GitHub Deployment: Successful
❌ Tenant Login: Failing with 400 error
```

**Root Cause:** The login page on honeynwild.com is using an old version that doesn't properly send the login request.

---

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**

### **Step 1: Upload Latest Login Page**

1. **Go to your cPanel File Manager**
2. **Navigate to:** `public_html/` (or your honeynwild.com root directory)
3. **Find file:** `immigration-portal-login-production.html`
4. **Delete the old version**
5. **Upload the NEW version from:**
   ```
   c:\Main_Data\AI\immigration-appV1\honeynwild-integration-files\immigration-portal-login-production.html
   ```

### **Step 2: Verify Upload**

1. Open browser: `https://honeynwild.com/immigration-portal/login`
2. Right-click → "View Page Source"
3. Search for: `"URL-based transfer mode"`
4. ✅ If found → Upload successful
5. ❌ If not found → Upload failed, try again

### **Step 3: Test Again**

After uploading, inform me and I'll run the test again.

## 📁 **File Location:**

**Local Path:**
```
c:\Main_Data\AI\immigration-appV1\honeynwild-integration-files\immigration-portal-login-production.html
```

**Server Path (cPanel):**
```
public_html/immigration-portal-login-production.html
```

---

## 🔍 **How to Confirm It's the Right File:**

The correct file should have:
- Line ~280: `console.log('🔄 Production login page loaded - URL-based transfer mode');`
- Line ~192: `const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/auth/login`, {`
- Line ~235: `const redirectUrl = `https://ibuyscrap.ca/auth-callback?data=${encodedData}`;`

---

## ⚠️ **Why This Matters:**

The backend code on `ibuyscrap.ca` is already fixed and deployed ✅  
But the login page on `honeynwild.com` is still using old code ❌  
They need to match for the login to work!

---

## 📞 **Next Steps:**

1. Upload the latest `immigration-portal-login-production.html` to honeynwild.com
2. Verify it's uploaded correctly
3. Inform me when done
4. I'll run the test again
5. Should see: ✅ Login successful → Redirect to tenant dashboard
