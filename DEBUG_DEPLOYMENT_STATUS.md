# üîç DEBUG DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS

## What I Did:

I apologize for the initial incorrect assumption. You were right - the file WAS updated. I should have investigated deeper first.

### **Root Cause Investigation:**

The login API is returning `400 Validation Error` but WITHOUT the detailed `errors` array. This means:

1. ‚ùå NOT coming from `validateLoginMiddleware` (would say "Validation failed")
2. ‚úÖ Coming from the global error handler (says "Validation Error")
3. ü§î Something is throwing a ValidationError BEFORE the request body is properly parsed

### **What I Added:**

Comprehensive debug logging to `authController.ts` login endpoint:
- Logs the entire request body
- Logs content-type header
- Logs tenant headers
- Logs body type and keys
- Logs if email/password are missing

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for GitHub Actions deployment
2. **Make a test login request** from honeynwild.com
3. **Check server console logs** (they should appear in CloudWatch or PM2 logs)
4. **Identify the exact issue** from the debug output

### **Expected Debug Output:**

If the request body is empty or malformed, we'll see:
```
üîç LOGIN DEBUG - Request received: {
  body: undefined,  ‚Üê or {}
  bodyType: 'undefined',
  bodyKeys: 'no body'
}
```

If the request is correct, we'll see:
```
üîç LOGIN DEBUG - Request received: {
  body: { email: 'admin@honeynwild.com', password: '...' },
  bodyType: 'object',
  bodyKeys: ['email', 'password']
}
```

### **Deployment Status:**

- ‚úÖ Code committed
- ‚úÖ Pushed to GitHub  
- ‚è≥ GitHub Actions deploying... (check: https://github.com/askeywa/Immigration/actions)
- ‚è≥ Waiting for completion...
